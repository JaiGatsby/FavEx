##Inspiration
College students lead busy lives. It is almost inevitable that there be moments that they need a helping hand. And that is what we hope to help with. A community of people all helping each other in their times of need is what we envision.

##What it does
FavEx is a platform wherein people who need favours can post requests and others who happen to be in the area or have the time can help out. Ofcourse we don't expect to rely on just the gratitude of people, instead we implemented an incentive based system wherein one gains points by doing favours and spends those points while getting favours done.

##How we built it
Ionic framework upon Cordova, with Axure database running MySql

##Challenges we ran into
None of us knew AngularJS, or even regular JS, which is a base pre-requisite for Ionic.

##Accomplishments that we're proud of
